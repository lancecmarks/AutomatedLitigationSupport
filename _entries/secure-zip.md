SecureZIP for Windows is a full-featured encryption and compression application.  Full-disk or volume encryption is a single-use-case approach that leaves information exposed at the data level.  Persistent data-level encryption has become a necessity, especially with highly sensitive information.

Data secured using SecureZIP for Windows stays secure regardless of where it is stored, e.g., on a hard drive, a flash drive, CDs or DVDs, or even in the cloud using cloud-based storage services. In addition, you can use SecureZIP to create SecureZIP archives where all content is encrypted, including the filenames.

Two common methods for securing encrypted files are passphrase and digital certificate-based encryption (the latter is also reffered to as public key infrastructure [PKI] encryption).  SecureZIP allows you to use either approach.
